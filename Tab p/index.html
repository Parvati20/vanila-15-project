                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Raigad Fort was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The chief architect and engineer was none other
                    than Hiroji Indulkar. The main fort has the queen's quarters, private restrooms and six chambers in
                    all. There are ruins of a market, which was accessed by horseback riders once.</p>
                <p>Shivaji changed its name to Raigad Fort in 1662. Shivaji, his architects and engineers, rebuilt and
                    fortified the structure, according to the Raigad Development Authority website. It is the place
                    where Shivaji was coronated on 6 June, 1674 and where he took the title Chhatrapati.</p>

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>Raigad is a hill fort located in Maharashtra, India. It was the capital of the Maratha Empire, and it
                    offers breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. From the top, you can see the lush
                    greenery, the majestic Sahyadri mountain range, and even the Arabian Sea on a clear day. It's a
                    truly awe-inspiring sight!</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>The goals of Raigad were primarily strategic and administrative. As the capital of the Maratha
                    Empire, it served as the center of power for the empire and its ruler, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
                    The fort was designed to be easily defendable, with its high elevation and strong fortifications. It
                    also housed various administrative buildings, including the royal palace, courtrooms, and other
                    structures for governance. The main goal was to establish a strong and centralized base for the
                    Maratha Empire and to project power throughout the region.</p>
